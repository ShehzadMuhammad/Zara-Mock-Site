# Zara-Store

A mock store containing Zara clothing and shoes, this is a full stack application using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node)
It's the first full stack project i made. When creating this project I learned Node and Express, Redux and Mongo DB (I used Mongo Atlas for my database)
